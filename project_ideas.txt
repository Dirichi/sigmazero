- try skewed probability transitions
	- ***IMPORTANT***: make sure the state transitions and transition rewards are same as the other experiments
		- just replace the probabilities only
- try different branching factors
- try bigger state representation size for muzero
- try more simulations for muzero

- maybe try transition rewards sampled from a non-uniform distribution?
